# README

This project was done so that I can learn about RSpec, which is a behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework. Instead of saying, "This unit test is for this functionality," a BDD approach might be to say, "this unit test is for this business value." RSpec allows you to quickly create Ruby specs for testing various logic in your application. Using Rails 6 RSpec, I start by creating an app and adding a basic scaffold and Devise users. Then I set about testing some of the functionalities.

What I've learnt From This Project?

* Using Rails 6 RSpec To Test The Application

* Testing The Models

* Testing The Views

* Testing The Controller Actions

* Testing Helper Methods With RSpec
